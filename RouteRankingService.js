// this file can hold functions to process ranking the routes from
// routeResultArray. Perhaps by assigning a ranking to the ranking member
// of each route object, or by simply sorting the list

// will need to depend on what user preferences are set as well
// e.g. if distance more important than incline, then we sort by that?

// we could perhaps even assign more ranking fields to the routeSummary object
// based on how well each
